# Estimates for Omicron across countries

## Growth advantage random walk (GARW) $R_{t}$ model

### Case estimates and projections

This figure shows posterior variant-specific incidence obtained from our GARW model. This includes a 7 day forward projection assuming growth rates are unchanged.

### Variant frequencies and projections

This shows the posterior variant frequencies obtained from our GARW model.

### Effective reproduction number estimates and projections

This figure shows posterior smoothed cases as well as the effective reproduction number by variant.

### Epidemic growth rate estimates and projections

This figure shows the posterior smooth cases as well as the epidemic growth rate as based on the posterior effective reproduction number and assumed generation time.
