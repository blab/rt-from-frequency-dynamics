# Estimates for Omicron BA.2.75

## Growth advantage random walk (GARW) $R_{t}$ model

All projections are 7-day projections assuming no change in underlying growth rates. Projection period begins with gray dotted line.

### Case estimates and projections

This figure shows posterior variant-specific incidence obtained from our GARW model.
