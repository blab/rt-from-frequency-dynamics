# Estimates for Omicron across US states

## Growth advantage random walk (GARW) $R_{t}$ model

All projections are 7-day projections assuming no change in underlying growth rates. Projection period begins with gray dotted line.

### Case estimates and projections

This figure shows posterior variant-specific incidence obtained from our GARW model.

### Epidemic growth rate estimates and projections

This figure shows the posterior smooth cases as well as the epidemic growth rate as based on the posterior effective reproduction number and assumed generation time.
